Project : DataAnalysis on Covid-19 dataset

workdone : 
	 Dataset downloaded by "kaggle" through browser 
	 By using the libraries like pandas,matplotlib,seaborn the data is been present.
	 By using groupby, value count get the number of cases for recovered and and Deaths rates.
	 Get  information which region has highest recovery rate.
	 Get information which region has lowest deaths rates.
	 In Which region minimum number of death cases are recorded.
	 how many confirmed ,recovered, deaths rates in a US
	 And also represent with the graphs like(bar,heatmap,pairplot,pieplot) to get clear observation of cases.

Conclusion:
	This dataset includes data tracking the number of people affected by COVID-19 worldwide, including:

	1) confirmed tested cases of Coronavirus infection

	2) the number of people who have reportedly recovered from it

	3) the number of people who have reportedly died while sick with Coronavirus

	4) And some graphical represention that show the proper indication of Recovered cases, Death cases etc.
  
  5) we had shown the comparison between US and Mainland china with the percentage of death,confirmed ,recovery cases it both regions

steps for conclusion:
	1)show the number of death and recovery cases in each region
	2)this shows the confirmed cases in the regiona nd its been sorted in highest cases found in region
	  (here we are spearating the specific column info
	3)Average recovered, death rates in specific region or specific state
  4) Total confirm,death and recovered cases of US And Mainland China
  5) Average rate of US and Mainland China Cases
  
RESULT:
From above points we colclude that in "US" and "mainland china" Max Recovery percent of both country are with repect to region ("US"=1.27% & "ML-China"=3.23%)
Max Deaths percent of both country are with repect to region ("US"=3.45% &"Ml-China"=16.13%) Max Confirmed percent of both country are with repect to region ("US"=1.72% & "MlChina"=3.23)
so while looking at these figures and the above data is of one day"29/04/2020" we can predict that Recovery chances of US is less compare to china on that day, death rates chances of
"china" is more and Confirmed found cases are more of "China" than "US".
However these pridiction is calculate for day "29/04/2020" we can assume that "Us" is in satble position stable compare to "china" where china is faceing more deaths rates
